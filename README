This is a bunch of helpful stuff that I wrote, often for other projects, all
put together into one "project" for more convenient distribution and hopefully
discovery by others who can use something here. I've tried to shove as much as
I can under The MIT License for maximum reuse potential. Anything without an
explicit license declaration or reference at the top of the file should be
assumed to be released under The MIT License (see the file LICENSE-MIT)

Two (totally optional) requests:

1. If you use something here, let me know: jody@jodybruchon.com is always open!

2. If this is useful to you, consider tossing me a subscription or one-time
   contribution at SubscribeStar:  https://subscribestar.com/JodyBruchon

Happy hacking!


***** DESCRIPTION OF SOME SNIPPETS *****

6502 CPU assembly code (in ACME Cross-Assembler format)
-------------------------------------------------------
6502/byte2bin: convert a byte to an 8-character string of binary digits
6502/blockmove: move a block of memory (including sizes over >256 bytes)
6502/detect6502: detect what variant of 6502/65816 CPU is in use
6502/divide_16-8-8: divide 16-bit number by 8-bit number
6502/divide_8-8-8: divide 8-bit number by 8-bit number
6502/multiply_8-8-16: multiply two 8-bit numbers
6502/pagefill: fill a 1-256 byte area of memory with a value
6502/pagemove: move a block of memory (256 bytes or less)

C functions (and header files to use them)
------------------------------------------
c/byteplane_xfrm: byte-plane transform from lzjody (see byteplane_xfrm.png)
c/jody_cacheinfo: get cpu0 cache sizes from standard sysfs path on Linux
c/jody_endian: endianness detection and conversion (untested)
c/jody_paths: pathname processing functions used in jdupes for link names
c/jody_sort: numerically correct file name compare function (for sorting)
c/jody_string: str[n][case]cmp that returns only equality (faster)
c/jody_strstr: two-way strstr() that is relatively fast and quite small
c/jody_strtoepoch: convert datetime string to seconds since the epoch
c/jody_win_unicode: Windows Unicode helpers for aiding portability
c/strcat_fixed: a faster strcat() for when string length is already known
c/string_malloc: a simple, fast memory allocator for small pieces  of data
c/win_stat: Windows stat() and NT-to-UNIX epoch portability helper code

Shell scripts (POSIX sh and/or GNU Bash)
----------------------------------------
shell_scripts/ansicolors.sh:
    ANSI color escape sequences for shell script echo
shell_scripts/change_hplj_status.sh:
    change READY message on old HP LaserJet printer displays
shell_scripts/count_total_files_in_directory.sh:
    shows how many files are under each subdirectory of the current one
shell_scripts/gather_file_dir_statistics.sh:
    shows various file/directory stats, including avg/min/max file size
