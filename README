Helpful snippets by Jody Bruchon <jody@jodybruchon.com>

https://github.com/jbruchon/snippets

This is a bunch of helpful stuff that I wrote, often for other projects, all
put together into one "project" for more convenient distribution and hopefully
discovery by others who can use something here. I've tried to shove as much as
I can under The MIT License for maximum reuse potential.

Two (totally optional) requests:

1. If you use something here, let me know: jody@jodybruchon.com is always open!

2. If this is useful to you, consider tossing me a subscription or one-time
   contribution at SubscribeStar:  https://subscribestar.com/JodyBruchon

Happy hacking!
