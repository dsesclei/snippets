I used this to catch the program CompanionLink closing down silently and cause
it to start back up. This directory includes a Windows Task Scheduler task that
is used to invoke the check and restart. I don't remember why, but I had to use
the included VBScript file to invoke the batch file from the task rather than
calling the batch file directly.

This can probably be used to watch-and-restart any program rather easily.
